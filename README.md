# MedGive
A web application that connects medicine donors with NGOs to redistribute unused, unexpired medicines to those in need. Donors can list surplus medicines, and verified NGOs can browse and request them for distribution. The platform features user authentication, donation tracking, and a responsive UI for seamless interaction.
